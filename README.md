## Site Framework
I want to learn how to implement transitions in my web pages, so I selected the DORO template from ThemeForest for the site. The template has beautiful transitions; I want to take it apart to see how to implement those for myself.

## Content
I touch upon areas of focus both from work and from my development class. In Projects, select a tile to view content for a given area. Areas include:

> XML Authoring
> XSLT Web Transforms 
> Web App Development
> MySQL Apps
> JavaScript and JQuery Projects
> API Projects

There are two collaborative projects in my demo collection; I've pinned these in GitHub as a contributor. I think it's important to see collaborative efforts as well as solo projects.

You may also note that I mention chat bots and guided interface tours; these are the solutions I plan to tackle with the skills I've aquired.
